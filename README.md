# DataEnvelopmentAnalysis

DataEnvelopmentAnalysis is a personal repository that has an implementation of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). It supports both the CCR (Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes) and BCC (Banker, Charnes, and Cooper) models, both input and output oriented.

In addition to the standard version that analyzes efficiency, DataEnvelopmentAnalysis also includes an effectiveness analysis. This analysis incorporates goals to be achieved for each DMU in each resources in classic DEA models. By specifying the appropriate parameters when calling the functions, you can define which type of model will be used.

An example is provided in the run.ipynb file, and a college project presentation can be found in the Aplicacao_DEA.pdf document.
